# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
Minecraft players often want to know which servers are online and who is currently playing, without having to launch the game or rely on unreliable third-party lists. This project solves that by providing a reliable, device-agnostic way to check server status and player lists.

## Problems It Solves
- Difficulty in finding out if a server is online or down.
- Uncertainty about which friends or players are currently active.
- Lack of a unified, mobile-friendly interface for server status.

## How It Should Work
- Users enter a server address or select from a list.
- The app displays server status, player count, and optionally, a list of online players.
- Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile browsers.

## User Experience Goals
- Fast, clear feedback on server status.
- Minimal steps to get information.
- Visually appealing and themed for Minecraft fans.
- No login required for basic use.
