# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Establishing and maintaining the Memory Bank documentation system.
- Ensuring all core documentation files are present and accurate.

## Recent Changes
- Created initial Memory Bank files: projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md.

## Next Steps
- Keep Memory Bank updated as the project evolves.
- Add progress.md and update as features are built/tested.
- Document any new patterns, decisions, or technical changes.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Documentation-first approach: all significant changes must be reflected in the Memory Bank.
- Prioritize clarity and completeness in documentation.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Use the Memory Bank as the single source of truth for project context.
- Update activeContext.md and progress.md frequently.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Good documentation is essential for continuity, especially with memory resets.
